# VSCode Network Tools

The goal of this extension is to provide a set useful tools for anyone that needs to analyze the network. Tested and optimized for large files.


## Features

* PCAP and PCAPNG file viewer with parsers for the following protocols:
    * Ethernet II
    * SLL2
    * Raw IP
    * 802.1Q VLAN
    * PPPoE
    * ARP
    * IPv4
    * IPv6
    * GRE
    * MPLS
    * IP-in-IP
    * IGMP
    * TCP
    * UDP
    * DHCP 
    * ICMP
    * ICMPv6
    * DNS & mDNS
    * HTTP
    * VXLAN
    * TLS (Header type only)
    * QUIC (Header type only)

* Ability to search within and copy/paste from ouput.

* Ability to save as text to make sharing content easier.

* Ability to highlight or filter on packet types or endpoints.

* Maximum compatibility with PCAP and PCAPNG files, including those output by pktmon and wireshark, with graceful handling of unknown protocols.

![User opens a pcapng file named pktmon-dhcp.pcapng using the extension. The user then navigates the menus](https://github.com/CusanzaBros/vscode-net-tools/blob/main/demo.gif?raw=true)
